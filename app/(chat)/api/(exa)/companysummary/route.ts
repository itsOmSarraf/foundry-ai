      Headings could be the companys's: Main Product, Target Users, Pricing, Goal, Strengths, and more key points, whichever are relevant. Don't have to include a specific heading if it doesn't have enough source about it, and you can also make up your own headings whichever seems apt.
      
      Don't make up any information yourself, only use the information which is given in the above content.

      It should be (an emoji with heading) and then text with it. Give maximum 6 headings (the most important ones).

      The text/description should be short, simple and easy to understand.
